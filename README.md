This project leverages the capabilities of computer vision and trained algorithm models designed for object detection, combined with optimal path-planning algorithms, to develop an autonomous system. The system integrates a DJI Tello drone and a standard laptop to autonomously detect and follow a user while simultaneously calculating and navigating an optimized path to a designated target. The drone processes real-time video to identify
obstacles and dynamically adapt the path, ensuring efficient and accurate navigation between the user and the target.
